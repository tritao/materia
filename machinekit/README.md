# MachineKit

MachineKit is a Haxe-only layer of machine components above CadKit. A
`MachineComponent` pairs a geometry generator with named connector frames and a
BOM line. `addTo(model, id)` registers an instance and its connectors on a
CadKit `AssemblyModel`, so components mate through the existing assembly API.

Connector frames use the CadKit joint convention: mated frames coincide, and
revolute or prismatic joints act along the frame's +Y axis. Component CAD
frames put their axis along +Z, and every connector's +Y points along +Z.

Geometry fidelity is selected with `ComponentDetail`: `Envelope` gives exact
standard boundary dimensions, and `Preview` adds recognizable exterior features
with simplified internals. Threads are semantic (size, pitch, length) and are
not modelled.

Standard sizes live in typed `Catalog` tables, separate from the generators.
Each component also produces the machining it needs:

| Component | Catalog | Companion geometry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeepGrooveBearing` | 625–6205, ISO 15 boundary dimensions | `housingSeat()`, `journalDiameter()` |
| `SocketHeadCapScrew` | M3–M12, ISO 4762 heads | `clearanceHole()` (ISO 273), `tapHole()`, `counterboreHole()` (DIN 974-1) |
| `HexBolt` | M3–M12, ISO 4017 heads | `clearanceHole()`, `tapHole()`, `counterboreHole()` |
| `HexNut` | M3–M12, ISO 4032 | `pocket()` for a trapped-nut recess |
| `FlatWasher` | M3–M12, ISO 7089 | — |
| `NemaStepper` | NEMA 17, 23, 34 | `mountingCutout()`, `mountScrew()`, `boltPattern()` |
| `ParallelKey` | DIN 6885-1 form A, by shaft diameter | — |
| `RetainingRing` | DIN 471 external, by shaft diameter | — |
| `ShaftCollar` | set-screw type, by bore diameter | — |
| `SteppedShaft` | — (built from arbitrary sections) | keyway and retaining-ring groove cuts, `diameterAt()` |

`SteppedShaft` stacks coaxial cylindrical sections along +Z, producing square
shoulders at each diameter change. Keyways are cut on the shaft's local +Y
side, so a `ParallelKey` mated through the keyway's connector with a fixed
joint sits flush in the slot. Retaining-ring grooves add a connector of their
own name when given one, for a `RetainingRing` mated the same way.

`examples/MotorShaftBearings.hx` mounts a NEMA 17 motor on a plate with four
M3 screws and carries an output shaft on two 608 bearings through a continuous
coupling joint. The shaft steps down past the outboard bearing to carry a
retaining ring and an output key. It also produces the aggregated BOM.

## Structural

`machinekit.structural` builds machine bases and frames from named 3D points
and straight members, rather than the connector-mating model above: a frame is
one rigid weldment, not a kinematic mechanism, so members carry no assembly
joints. Each cross-section (`RectTube`, `RoundTube`, `Angle`, `Channel`,
`FlatBar`) implements `StructuralProfile` and extrudes itself along local +Z
to a caller-chosen length, the same axis convention as every other generator.

`FrameAssembly` registers named points with `point(name, x, y, z)`, then
members with `member(name, start, end, profile)`. `geometry(name)` extrudes
and places a member in world space between its two points; a member's local
+X (a channel's open side, an angle's leg corner, ...) follows an optional
`reference` vector projected perpendicular to the member's axis, defaulting to
+Z (or +Y for a nearly vertical member). `cutList()` aggregates member lengths
by profile designation.

Run the smoke tests after building CadKit's native library:

```sh
./machinekit/scripts/test-haxeon
```

Set `CADKIT_BUILD_ROOT` when CadKit was built somewhere other than
`cadkit/build/debug`.
