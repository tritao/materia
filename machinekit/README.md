# MachineKit

MachineKit is a Haxe-only layer of machine components above CadKit. A
`MachineComponent` pairs a geometry generator with named connector frames and a
BOM line. `addTo(model, id)` registers an instance and its connectors on a
CadKit `AssemblyModel`, so components mate through the existing assembly API.

Connector frames use the CadKit joint convention: mated frames coincide, and
revolute or prismatic joints act along the frame's +Y axis. Component CAD
frames put their axis along +Z, and every connector's +Y points along +Z.

Geometry fidelity is selected with `ComponentDetail`: `Envelope` gives exact
standard boundary dimensions, and `Preview` adds recognizable exterior features
with simplified internals. Threads are semantic (size, pitch, length) and are
not modelled.

Standard sizes live in typed `Catalog` tables, separate from the generators.
Each component also produces the machining it needs:

| Component | Catalog | Companion geometry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeepGrooveBearing` | 625–6205, ISO 15 boundary dimensions | `housingSeat()`, `journalDiameter()` |
| `SocketHeadCapScrew` | M3–M12, ISO 4762 heads | `clearanceHole()` (ISO 273), `tapHole()`, `counterboreHole()` (DIN 974-1) |
| `NemaStepper` | NEMA 17, 23, 34 | `mountingCutout()`, `mountScrew()`, `boltPattern()` |

`examples/MotorShaftBearings.hx` mounts a NEMA 17 motor on a plate with four
M3 screws and carries an output shaft on two 608 bearings through a continuous
coupling joint. It also produces the aggregated BOM.

Run the smoke tests after building CadKit's native library:

```sh
./machinekit/scripts/test-haxeon
```

Set `CADKIT_BUILD_ROOT` when CadKit was built somewhere other than
`cadkit/build/debug`.
