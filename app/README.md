# Reference editor shell

This is the smallest app-side integration example for the shared Haxeon UI
widgets. `src/Main.hx` owns the editor state and composes:

- a persisted `DockWorkspaceModel` with Hierarchy, Viewport, Inspector,
  Console, and Telemetry panels;
- `TreeView`, `GpuViewport`, `PropertyInspector`, and `PlotView` panel content;
- one `CommandRegistry` shared by the toolbar, context menu, and command
  palette;
- right-click viewport context actions plus keyboard shortcuts for save, frame,
  palette, and workspace reset;
- a file-backed docking snapshot under `build/reference-editor-workspace.json`
  (override it with `REFERENCE_EDITOR_WORKSPACE`).

`Main` is a complete desktop host. It initializes NativeKit, creates a resizable
window and GPU surface, routes typed native input into the shared `UiContext`,
and renders from the surface's request-driven frame callback. The main thread
drains the event queue and waits between frames, while resize, scale, surface
loss, shutdown, and callback failures are handled explicitly. Embedders can
still create `ReferenceEditorApp` directly and call `view()`/`submit(frame)`
from another host.

Run the editor with:

```sh
../haxeon/scripts/haxeon run --project haxeon.json
```

Use `--snapshot` after `--` for the headless workspace JSON path, or
`--reset-workspace` to discard the persisted panel arrangement before startup.

To connect the editor to a running headless robot process, pass its TCP
endpoint. The editor keeps its own NativeKit event loop and uses RobotKit's
typed client over loopback:

```sh
../haxeon/scripts/haxeon run --project haxeon.json -- \
  --robot=127.0.0.1:17890
```

For a deterministic diagnostic run, render a bounded number of frames and
capture the visual, structural, application, event, and performance state:

```sh
../haxeon/scripts/haxeon run --project haxeon.json -- \
  --capture-dir=build/captures/default --frames=3
```

The capture directory contains `frame.png`, `ui-tree.txt`, `layout.json`,
`app-state.json`, `frame-metrics.json`, and `events.jsonl`. Paths are resolved
from the app project directory. Native PNG capture currently uses ImageMagick's
`import`; if it is unavailable or cannot access the desktop session, the other
artifacts are still written along with `screenshot-error.txt`.

UIKit's reusable Component Lab can be opened through the same desktop host:

```sh
../haxeon/scripts/haxeon run --project haxeon.json -- --lab
../haxeon/scripts/haxeon run --project haxeon.json -- \
  --story=text-field/editing --capture-dir=build/captures/text-field --frames=3
```

Applications can supply their own `ComponentStoryRegistry`; the built-in lab
catalog is used when no registry is provided.

The project metadata lives in `haxeon.json`; the UI showcase compiler command
is the reference for supplying the shared UI and FFI source roots when building
this app against the repository checkout.
